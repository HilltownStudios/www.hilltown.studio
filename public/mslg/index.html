                        Planned destination was one of several pre-identified exoplanets

                    <p>
                        To save on life support costs, the flight crew consists of select 
                        members of the Extended Contractors Union, who agreed to indefinite
                        reanimation as a means of supporting family left behind after their
                        untimely demise. They cannot speak, but are tirelessly devoted to 
                        their mission.
