                        A characteristic of mosslings is that they sort of appear unnoticed, such that parties
                        suddenly or gradually become aware of them. Grumble's passing was noticed, however, as
                        he downed a foul crookhorn in Droomen Knoll before its companions overwhelmed him. He
                        perished ere he could receive the ministrations of Goodsman Emory.

                            Our comrade who we barely knew <br>
                            Slain by one who ate Woodgrue <br>
                            He said not a lot <br>
                            Now interred in a pot <br>
                            Oh Grumble, we will miss you
