                        A characteristic of mosslings is that they sort of appear unnoticed, such that parties
                        suddenly or gradually become aware of them. Grumble's passing was noticed, however, as
                        he downed a foul crookhorn on Droomen Knoll before its companions overwhelmed him. He
                        perished ere he could receive the ministrations of Goodsman Emory.

                        Inspector Shiitake found his investigations cut short in a dramatic confrontation with 
                        Paronax and his Mycotaur. Like other grimalkins, his physical form in the mortal realm 
                        was sustained only by fey magic, and one imagines he has returned to the land of Fairy, 
                        leaving nothing but his worldly goods behind. Legend speaks of a farm where grimalkins 
                        retire once their time in the mortal realm is finished, a place they can lick their 
                        wounds before perhaps trying their luck again.
