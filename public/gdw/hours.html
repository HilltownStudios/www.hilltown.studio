                                    <p> Pluritine Observances: The largest observance is in Prigwort. Throughout 
                                        the Wood, folk enjoy a pageant wherein the eponymous saint is to be

                                        Throughout most of the Wood, there is little variation in the contrivances,
                                        namely that the executioners are unable to bring down their axe. In 
                                        Prigwort, however, folk delight in inventing new contrivances to prevent
                                        the execution of their saint.</p>
