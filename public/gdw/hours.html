                                        their prized cows and crown them with a flower wreath. They lead their 
                                        cows in a procession through town, then walk deasil around the local 
                                        church seven times. After the ceremony, the cows are moved to the summer 
                                        fields. </p>

                                    <p> Pluritine Observances: The largest observance is in Prigwort. Throughout 
                                        the Wood, folk enjoy a pageant wherein the eponymous saint is to be 
                                        executed for treason, but is thrice spared by various contrivances. 
                                        Throughout most of the Wood, there is little variation in the contrivances,
                                        namely that the executioners are unable to bring down their axe. In 
                                        Prigwort, however, folk delight in inventing new contrivances to prevent
                                        the execution of their saint.</p>
