                    <h3 id="ability-scores" part="index-h3">Ability Scores</h3>
                    <p>Ability score rolls are made in order, 3d6 for each ability.</p>
                    <p>Players may use the sub-par characters optional rule when rolling ability scores (See DPB, p. 18).</p>
                    <p>Players may swap any two scores after rolling is complete.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Hit Points</h3>
                    <p>PCs start with maximum hit points at first level (CON bonus still applies; see DPB, p. 19).</p>
                    
                    <h3>Class Options</h3>
                    <p>All kin and classes are available for play. There may be social consequences for choosing specific kin, especially elves and grimalkins.</p>
                    <p>Fighters may select the following combat talent whenever they are eligible to do so:</p>
                    <p><blockquote>Great strength: The fighter's strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 18.</blockquote></p>
                    <p>Bards, Hunters, and Thieves may use the optional rules to customize their skills (See DPB pp. 58, 69, 75).</p>
                    <p>PCs may use the Simple Spellbooks optional rule (See DPB p. 78).</p>
                    
                    <h3>XP and Leveling Up</h3>
                    <p>In addition to gaining XP via treasure and defeating foes, PCs may gain XP from exploration. (See DCB p. 107) (DM's note: I will provide the table for this.)</p>
                    <p>PCs must spend a period of time training in order to increase level. Until the training is complete, the character cannot advance to the next Level and can gain no further XP. (See DPB p. 25)</p>
