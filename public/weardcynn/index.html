                    Weardcynn (Weh-ARD-kin) is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) made for one Game Master (GM) and at
                    least one player. Players act as competent adventurers in a harsh and unforgiving world in search of
                    lost treasures, forgotten knowledge, and any other tools that will help them and their kin survive.
                <blockquote style="color: #68c7f6;">
                    <p>
                        The world of Weardcynn is what's left of a far-future earth that has risen up and overthrown its
                        most persistent parasites, mankind, hereafter referred to as Manncynn. Manncynn still exist, but
                        are
                        much diminished, their primacy permanently hemmed in by the new champions of earth, the
                        Weardcynn.
                        These Weardcynn are themselves split between the hardliners who believe Manncynn cannot be
                        trusted
                        at all and those who have tentatively allied themselves with Manncynn on the assumption that
                        their
                        enemies can learn new ways. From these Weardcynn, the Manncynn have learned magic and other
                        useful
                        skills, which has helped them stave off extinction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Manncynn settlements, ranging from highly portable hut villages to the musty remnants of old
                        stone
                        cities, are few and separated by vast stretches of hostile terrain: overgrown forests, salt
                        flats
                        and deserts, marshes and wetlands, and mountains whose passes are ever choked with snow.
                        Exploration
                        and discovery are still drivers of the human spirit, however, and while they negotiate their
                        place
                        among hostile equals, the Manncynn seek connections with one another and together unearth clues
                        about who they once were from the long lost ruins of their dead civilizations.

                <h2 id="rules-overview" part="index-h2">ᚢ. Rules Overview</h2>
                <p>This is a brief overview of the major rules of Weardcynn.</p>
                <p>
                    Whenever a character's actions have an uncertain (i.e., interesting) result, you'll expend effort
                    and roll dice. Combat, magic, leechcraft, and most kinds of actions performed in the wilderness or
                    in dungeons require action rolls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Weardcynn, there are two concepts that will underpin all action rolls: Effort
                    Pool and Ability Scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Action rolls are d20 dice pools. Select the ability score to use for the action roll, spend points
                    from your Effort Pool to perform an action, then roll that many d20s. Success usually occurs when
                    you roll <b>under</b> the ability score used on at least one of the d20s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your character's Effort Pool depletes as you perform actions. Resting replenishes the Effort Pool.
                    Magic, leechcraft, and some other abilities can also help replenish Effort Pools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an action does damage, that damage is applied to an ability score. Armor and other means of
                    defense subtract from the damage before it's applied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an ability score is reduced to 0 points, the character usually dies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only long-term rest can reliably restore damaged ability scores. During this long-term rest, the
                    character must engage in specific activities outlined in their background. Less reliable methods of
                    restoring damaged ability scores include magic and leechcraft.
                </p>

                        <p>When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character’s ability scores,
                            in order. They may then swap any two of the results.</p>

                        <p>The Effort Pool represents a character's capacity to act in the world by expending effort. It
                            is a resource that can be depleted and replenished.</p>
                        <p>Player Characters start the game with an Effort Pool of 11.</p>

                        <h4 id="inventory" part="index-h4">Possessions and Inventory</h4>
                        <p>
                            Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each
                            hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head). The backpack
                            can also double as an emergency sleeping bag but only if emptied of its contents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and
                            can be rearranged per the GM's discretion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bulky items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone
                            carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) can no longer move or perform actions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with
                            both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. Hirelings can also be paid to carry
                            equipment.

                    <h3 id="runebinding" part="index-h3">Runebinding</h3>
                    <p>
                        Largely the province of Runewitches, Runebinding is the act of affixing, or binding runes imbued
                        with power to people, places, or things in ways that channel their power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are 24 runes. A rune's specific use depends on its orientation and the ability score used
                        to bind it. Upright runes confer blessings while inverted runes confer curses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Binding a rune requires a ritual that includes materials, words, and gestures. To bind a rune,
                        perform the ritual and spend the required Effort Points to achieve the desired effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Runes can be bound as Fast, Middle, or Slow Actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When bound as a Fast Action, every failure on the Action roll deals a point of damage to the
                        ability score used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When bound as a Middle Action, each critical failure on the Action roll deals a point of damage
                        to the ability score used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When bound as a Slow Action, failure is harmless.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once a rune is bound, it affects its until the effect resolves or it is unbound or dispelled.

                    various historical depths; creating NPCs and factions; creating monsters (including converting
                    monsters from other games); and adjudicating the game. Also offers rules for developing backgrounds,
